I have learned about software design architecture. I learned about the different design patterns like client server, N-layer, MVC, Peer-To-Peer, and more. I have a project that I need to build and I want to know how to go about choosing an architecture that best suits the project needs. Here is the problem I am trying to solve:

I have an ecommerce website (Shopify) where I sell my products. I also have an ERP system where I manage accounting, inventory, sales orders, purchase orders and more. I need these two systems to be constantly exchanging data so that they are essentially in sync. For example, I need my inventory levels being synced from the ERP to Shopify. I need my orders being synced from Shopify to my ERP.

Here is the Project Objective:

I want to build a piece of software that essentially listens for incoming data from both systems. This incoming data will be transformed or operated on in some way, and then sent to the other system. The data coming in and out of the system almost always represents some object, for example when an item's inventory level changes, the incoming data to my project will be a JSON payload representing an inventory item. This means that it would be convenient to have models in my project that represent the types of objects being worked with. 

Please let me know if you need further clarification on the project objective. So, what software design architecture would best suit my project?




For your project, a **Message Broker Architecture with an N-Layer design** would be highly suitable. Here’s how it would align with your requirements:

### Why Message Broker Architecture?
This architecture works well for systems needing continuous, reliable data exchange between different applications like your ERP and Shopify. A message broker, such as RabbitMQ, Kafka, or AWS SQS, can facilitate asynchronous communication between the systems, handling the data exchange and syncing in real-time. This way, your ERP and Shopify systems remain loosely coupled, and each can continue to function independently even if there’s a temporary issue in data flow.

### Why N-Layer Design?
Using an N-layer approach (such as Presentation, Business, and Data Access layers) would allow you to handle different functions in a modular way:
1. **Presentation Layer:** Not strictly a UI in this case, but it could manage incoming JSON payloads from either system.
2. **Business Layer:** This layer would house the logic to transform or process data, ensuring inventory and order data is in the correct format for each system.
3. **Data Access Layer:** This layer would handle interactions with the message broker and APIs for ERP and Shopify, simplifying data exchange without having to manage low-level API calls directly in your main logic.

### Implementation Tips
- **Data Models:** Define models representing objects (e.g., inventory items, orders) that your system will handle. This approach aligns well with object-oriented practices and makes the transformation process more manageable.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Set up listeners for each system to process incoming data events asynchronously, sending transformed data to the other system without blocking operations.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** An N-layer architecture lets you add dedicated components for error handling, logging, and retry logic, which are essential in data-sensitive applications.

Let me know if you’d like further guidance on implementing any of these components!
